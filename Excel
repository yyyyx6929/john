1 ) message Button program

Sub Meassage_button()
MsgBox ("Welcome to Excel")
End Sub

2)create a 5 Sheet and loop them

Sub sheets()
    Dim Ws As Worksheet
    y = 2
    For Each Ws In ThisWorkbook.sheets
        ThisWorkbook.sheets("Loop Sheet").Cells(y, 1) = Ws.Name
        y = y + 1
        Next Ws
End Sub

3)Area of Shapes

https://best-excel-tutorial.com/57-vba-tutorial/225-create-own-function-vba

Function AreaRectangle(Height As Double, Width As Double) As Double

AreaRectangle = Width * Height

End Function

 

Function AreaTriangle(Side1 As Double, Side2 As Double, Side3 As Double) As Double

Dim p As Double

p = (Side1 + Side2 + Side3) / 2

AreaTriangle = Sqr(p * (p - Side1) * (p - Side2) * (p - Side3))

End Function

 

Function AreaSquare(Side As Double) As Double

AreaSquare = Side * Side

End Function

 

Function AreaCircle(Radius As Double) As Double

AreaCircle = 3.14159 * Radius * Radius

End Function

4)Arithmetic operation

No code create a table to add,sub,multi,Divide

5)Sales calculator
Sub Button1_Click()

Dim employee As String, total As Integer, sheet As Worksheet, i As Integer
total = 0
employee = InputBox("Enter the employee name (case sensitive)")
For Each sheet In Worksheets
For i = 2 To 13
If sheet.Cells(i, 2).Value = employee Then
total = total + sheet.Cells(i, 3).Value
End If
Next i
Next sheet
MsgBox ("Total sales of " & employee & " is " & total)


End Sub

MsgBox InStr("example text", "am")
End Sub

8)Number of Words 

Sub Button2_Click()
Dim wordcount As Long, rng As Range, s As String, n As Long
For Each rng In ActiveSheet.UsedRange.Cells
s = Application.WorksheetFunction.Trim(rng.Text)
n = 0
If s <> vbNullString Then
n = Len(s) - Len(Replace(s, " ", " ")) + 1
End If
wordcount = wordcount + n
Next rng
MsgBox wordcount & "words in this worksheet"
End Sub

9)Min and Max

Private Sub CommandButton1_Click()
Dim rng As Range
Dim dblmin As Double
Set rng = Sheet1.Range("D5:D14")
dblmin = Application.WorksheetFunction.Min(rng)
MsgBox dblmin
End Sub

Private Sub CommandButton2_Click()
Dim rng As Range
Dim dblmax As Double
Set rng = Sheet1.Range("D5:D14")
dblmax = Application.WorksheetFunction.Max(rng)
MsgBox dblmax
End Sub

10) Cash Flow Estimate

Dim rate As Double
Dim cf(50) As Double
Dim val As Double
rate = Range("B1").Value
cf(0) = Range("B3").Value
cf(1) = Range("C3").Value
cf(2) = Range("D3").Value
cf(3) = Range("E3").Value
cf(4) = Range("F3").Value
val = NPV(rate, cf)
Range("B4").Value = val
MsgBox ("cash flow is eatemasted"), vbInformation
